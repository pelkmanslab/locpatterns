%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%   The setting file parameters are as follows:
%       Examples when possible are given withparameters used by Battich et
%       al., 2013
%       - structSettings.PathToData ---> Path to file containing cell data.
%           e.g. C:\Path\To\Data\Data.mat
%       - structSettings.OutputFolder ---> Full path to output folder
%           e.g. C:\Output\folder\
%       - structSettings.MinClusterNumber ---> Minimal number of clusters.
%           e.g. 2
%       - structSettings.MaxClusterNumber ---> Maximal number of clusters.
%           e.g. 50
%       - structSettings.FirstRandomSampling  ---> Number of cells to be
%           sampled at random prior to calculation of data density. This is
%           used for data downsampling to avoid memory usage problems when
%           handling large number of cells. The number will depend on the 
%           memory availability of the current system. e.g. 70000
%       - structSettings.FeatureIndex  ---> Index of features in data set
%           to be used to generate the pattern classification. 
%           e.g. [1:5 7:10] 
%       - structSettings.NumberOfBins ---> Number of bins to divide the 
%           randomly sampled cells depending on estimation of the data
%	    density. This is done to sample cells representing all 
%	    phenotypes given by the features analyzed
%       - structSettings.CellSamplingsPerBin ---> Number of cells sampled
%           per bin
%	Note: the number of cells sampled will be approximatly 
%	    structSettings.NumberOfBins * structSettings.CellSamplingsPerBin
